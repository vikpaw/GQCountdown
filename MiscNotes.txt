I want to create a countdown timer in javascript. There are many.
This appears to be a basic set of files to achieve this.

I want to use the timer in Frog Learn, as part of a widget.

A widget requires javascript. It can also take css and html in the .ejs files which are used as views.

It would be nice to have additional options accessible by the user for config.

Options can be retrieved in the console from the user and passed to the code.
There are a number of different views/actions for ‘when in edit mode’, ‘when opened’.
